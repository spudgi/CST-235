In order 2 complete this assignment
I created a fileReader class 55
at first I added numbers into the words
to make them l00k like the letter5 they were
supposed to be but couldnt figure out how to 
add the numbers up without a space before or after
instead I added the 69 numbers 29 outside
of the words 2 and that worked out well 1
In order 2 make this work I had to have theBean
to create all my getters and setters 30 20
which is also serialized in order to apply it accrs the 
package -10 and a Main to house my printoutlns
